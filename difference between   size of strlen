sizeof vs strlen()

Type: Sizeof operator is a unary operator whereas strlen() is a predefined function in C
Data types supported: Sizeof gives actual size of any type of data (allocated) in bytes (including the null values) whereas get the length of an array of chars/string.
Evaluation size: sizeof() is a compile-time expression giving you the size of a type or a variable’s type. It doesn’t care about the value of the variable.
Strlen on the other hand, gives you the length of a C-style NULL-terminated string.




strlen() function to find the length of string.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char strng[] = "January";
    printf("Length of given string is: %lu\n", strlen(strng));
}

Output:
Length of given string is: 7



       Strlen()                                                                                                          Sizeof()


Strlen() is a predefined function, which is defined in a header file known as string.h.         Sizeof() is a unary operator or compile-time expression that calculates the amount of the memory                                                                                                                                                       occupied by a variable.
This method is used to find the length of an array of string or character.                       This method is used to find the actual size of data (allocated) in bytes.
It counts the numbers of characters in a string eliminating null values.                         It returns the size of an operand, not the string length (including null values).
It allocates memory at the runtime and look for the null value of variable.                      sizeof() does not care about the variable value.
Strlen() function works only with character strings                                              Sizeof() function returns the amount of memory allocated in bytes.
Return value in strlen() is long int.                                                            Return value in sizeof() is unsigned int.
There are only one syntax of strlen() which is int strlen(const char *str);                     There are three syntaxes of sizeof() 1) sizeof(type), 2) sizeof(variable-name), and 3) sizeof(expression):
