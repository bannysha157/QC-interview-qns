NAND and NOR gates are called universal gates because they perform all the Logic functions OR, AND and NOT.

Hint: In digital logic, a universal logic gate is a logic gate that can be used to construct all other â€“ logic gates like AND, OR & NOT. 
These basic gates can be represented or created with the help of universal logic gates.

What are the 3 universal gates?
3 universal gates are: NAND, NOR and Fredkin gate


Why NAND gate is called universal gate?
NAND Gate is called Universal Gates because all the other gates (NOT, AND, OR and NOR)can be created by using this gate.
